/**

Your default export should be importable from a subschema loader.
the keys that are allowed are
export default ({
operators,
templates,
processors,
types,
schemas,
validators,
styles,
transitions,
resolvers
});

By using this convention your app and any app that depends on your app will
have be automatically setup.


Example:
class Simple extends React.Component {

    render(){
       return <div>simple</div>
    }

}

//This type will be available to your schema as "Simple".
//It will use the key as the name of the type.


//Resolvers take a slightly diffrenent syntax where the propType
// key matches the resolver key. Or PropType is a single propType and resolver
// is a single resolver.
// resolver:[propTypes, resolvers]

export const types = { Simple };

export default ({types});
